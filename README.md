# Hopf_MOMs_Entropy
Detect MOMs (Metastable Oscillatory Modes) and calculate Shannon Entropy of the LFP phase covariance matrices throughout time 

Run the script MOM_Entropy.m, changing the variables: 
folder     % folder of the analysis 
K          % global coupling strength of the Hopf model of coupled oscillators
MD         % mean conduction delay of the Hopf model of coupled oscillators
