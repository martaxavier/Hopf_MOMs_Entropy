# Hopf_MOMs_Entropy
Detect MOMs (Metastable Oscillatory Modes) and calculate Shannon Entropy of the LFP phase covariance matrices throughout time 

Run the script MOM_Entropy.m, changing the variables: 
folder     % folder of the analysis 
K          % global coupling strength of the Hopf model of coupled oscillators
MD         % mean conduction delay of the Hopf model of coupled oscillators 

Matrices of simulated LFP activity can be generated using the Hopf Delay Toolbox: https://github.com/fcast7/Hopf_Delay_Toolbox
